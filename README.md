**﻿resume-screening-**
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on automating the resume screening process using Python. The primary goal is to develop a model that can efficiently and accurately evaluate resumes based on predefined criteria.

**Installation**
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/fartaletejal-cloud/Resume-Screening.git
cd Resume-Screening
pip install -r requirements.txt


**Follow these steps to use the project:**

Prepare your dataset of resumes. Preprocess the data using the provided scripts. Train the machine learning model. Use the trained model to screen new resumes. Detailed instructions for each step can be found in the Jupyter notebooks provided in the repository.

Dataset The dataset used for this project consists of resumes collected from various sources. The data is preprocessed to extract relevant features such as skills, experience, and education.

Model The project uses various machine learning models to evaluate resumes. These models are trained on labeled data to classify resumes based on predefined criteria. The models include:

Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines Random Forest Neural Networks Results The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are documented and visualized in the Jupyter notebooks.
